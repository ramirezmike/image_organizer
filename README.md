# image_organizer
A simple application to organize images into folders made in Rust. 

## Proposed Features/Goals:
  - Quick startup and be able to start categorizing images with just a few key commands
  - Keyboard-focused interface
  - Iterates through images in a folder and allow user to add tags
  - Progress bar / estimated time remaining
  - After images have been tagged, a batch job starts of either copying/linking images into folders based on tags
  - Sphere mode
  - Pause and resume
  - Key commands
    [ ] - skip to next untagged image
    { } - skip to next tagged image
    Enter/RightArrow - next image 
    LeftArrow - previous image
    Up/Down - navigate folders?
    A-z - setup a tag / use tag if one has been set for key
  - Mockup of UI:
